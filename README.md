# SocialMediaAPI

## Description
This week we needed to develop a Backend Social Media API using MongoDB / NoSQL

The task is to make a db that can create a user, that user have thoughts, and those thoughts can have reactions.
The users can also have friends added also.
You will see a demo runthrough of this VIA Insomnia.
